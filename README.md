## What does it do?

Soon.

## What are the benefits?

Soon.

## Are there any drawbacks?

Soon.

## Manufacturing

- 0.8mm PCB thickness.
- Castellated vias are optional. There are only six half-cut vias and the board is thin which generally doesn't result in torn up copper platting. A little cleanup is usually necessary to remove debris from the half-cut vias.
- Blue PCB colour because Sonic the Hedgehog.

## Programming

Use the code available https://github.com/wurthless-elektroniks/sega-tmss-killer-attiny85/. Program before assembly using programmer of choice.

## Where to Buy?

# Sega Mega Drive TMSS Logic Disable

Here is a simple logic based PCB to disable the TMSS. I designed it based on a schematic by Trimesh and put it here for completion.

## Manufacturing

- 0.8mm / 1mm / 1.2mm PCB thickness are all good. 1.6mm is unecessarily thick.
- Blue PCB colour because Sonic the Hedgehog.

## Where to Buy?

Soon.
