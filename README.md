# Sega Mega Drive TMSS Disable ATtiny Based Version

Coded by Wurthless-Elektroniks and designed by Consoles Unleashed.

A collaboration no one asked for and no one wanted, brings you a device no one needs.

The SEGA Mega Drive TMSS Disable. Catchiest name ever.

A quick solder board (QSB) PCB designed for Wurthless Elektroniks ATTINY code to disable TMSS in SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis consoles with no cuts or wires required.

## What does it do?

Details soon.

## What are the benefits?

Details soon.

## Are there any drawbacks?

Details soon. I am sure there are some.

## Manufacturing

- 0.8mm / 1mm PCB thickness for QSB versions. 0.8mm / 1mm / 1.2mm PCB thickness for basic version are all good. 1.6mm is unecessarily thick.
- Castellated vias are optional for QSB versions. There are only six half-cut vias and the board is thin which generally doesn't result in torn up copper platting. A little cleanup is usually necessary to remove debris from the half-cut vias.
- Blue PCB colour because Sonic the Hedgehog.

## Programming

Use the code available https://github.com/wurthless-elektroniks/sega-tmss-killer-attiny85/. Program before assembly using programmer of choice.

## Mod Kit Variations

There are three versions of this mod kit.

1 - A basic PCB requiring wires to install.

2 - A short quick solder board version with a pad to wire /MRES.

3 - A long quick solder board version that connects /MRES and includes a jumper to disable or enable the /MRES connection.

# Sega Mega Drive TMSS Disable Logic Based Version

Here is a simple logic based PCB to disable the TMSS. I designed it based on a schematic by Trimesh and put it here for completion. Not recomended over the ATtiny version.
