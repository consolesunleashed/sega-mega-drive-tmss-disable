# Sega Mega Drive TMSS Disable ATtiny Based Version

Coded by Wurthless-Elektroniks and designed by Consoles Unleashed.

A collaboration no one asked for and no one wanted, brings you a device no one needs.

The SEGA Mega Drive TMSS Disable. Catchiest name ever.

A quick solder board (QSB) PCB designed for Wurthless Elektroniks ATTINY code to disable TMSS in SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis consoles with no cuts or wires required.

## What does it do?

Details soon.

## What are the benefits?

Details soon.

## Are there any drawbacks?

Details soon. I am sure there are some.

## Manufacturing

- 0.8mm PCB thickness.
- Castellated vias are optional. There are only six half-cut vias and the board is thin which generally doesn't result in torn up copper platting. A little cleanup is usually necessary to remove debris from the half-cut vias.
- Blue PCB colour because Sonic the Hedgehog.

## Programming

Use the code available https://github.com/wurthless-elektroniks/sega-tmss-killer-attiny85/. Program before assembly using programmer of choice.

## Mod Kit Variations

There are two versions of this mod kit.

1 - A short version with a pad to wire /MRES.

2 - A long version that connects /MRES and includes a jumper to disable or enable the /MRES connection.

## Version History

Long version starts at v1.1 because of what is known as the clone problem in philosophy.

- v1.0 - 10/02/2025 (wrong footprint for ATTINY chip, no /MRES connection, and no longness)
- v1.1 - 27/03/2025 (correct ATTINY footprint, and /MRES pad added)

### QSB Long

- v1.0 - 10/02/2025 (wrong footprint for ATTINY chip, no /MRES connection, and no longness)

# Sega Mega Drive TMSS Disable Logic Based Version

Here is a simple logic based PCB to disable the TMSS. I designed it based on a schematic by Trimesh and put it here for completion. Not recomended over the ATtiny version.

## Manufacturing

- 0.8mm / 1mm / 1.2mm PCB thickness are all good. 1.6mm is unecessarily thick.
- Blue PCB colour because Sonic the Hedgehog.
